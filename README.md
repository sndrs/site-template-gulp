Basic site template.

To start the dev server, run `gulp dev`.

### Structure
The site is served from `/.tmp`, and built into `/dist`, both of which are created and managed by gulp. Edits should only be made in `/app`.

### Installation
Checkout the branch, then run:

    npm install
    bower install
